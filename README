Beeper is a super simplistic tool written in shoes that helps tracking my 20/5 working schedule (20 mins work/5 mins break).

The GUI is "super rich", all you'll find is three buttons there:

"Let's rock this" - starts a single work block

"Break time!" - starts a single break block

The end of each block is indicated with a sound and an alert msg.
